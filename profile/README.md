## Hi there 👋
## Database Management in Application Development:
#### Plan Database Schema:
```bash
-   Define the types of data to store
-   Determine relationships between data
-   Identify data access patterns
```
#### Database Management Systems: 
First, Choose the Right Database Solution, categorized into three primary types of Databases
```bash
- Relational Databases:
    -   PostgreSQL: Offers advanced features and reliability.
    -   MySQL: Known for its reliability and ease of use, MySQL is a popular choice for many applications.
    -   Microsoft SQL Server: A comprehensive RDBMS from Microsoft.
- NoSQL Databases:
    -   MongoDB: Popular for its scalability and flexibility.
    -   Firebase Realtime Database: Provides real-time data synchronization(syncing) and offline support.
- File-Based Databases:
    -   SQLite: Ideal for lightweight storage solutions. Offers lightweight and easy to set up features.
    -   CockroachDB: Designed for distributed SQL with strong consistency. Provides strong consistency and distributed SQL features.
```
#### Design Database Schema:  Fundamental Database Operations
- Database Creation: Initialize new database systems.
- Schema Design: Architect and deploy database schemas.
- Table Management: Handle creation, modification, and removal of tables.
  - Inserting Data               |   Organize and populate data sets
  - Updating Data                |   Amend existing data entries
  - Deleting Data                |   Eliminate unnecessary data
  - Querying Data                |   Conduct complex data queries
  - Managing Transactions        |   Control transaction processing
- Plan data migrations

#### Database ORM Operations 
- Define Models and Schemas
- Setup Relationships
- Perform Migrations
- Seed Initial Data
- Optimize Queries
- Handle and Debug Database Errors

#### Common Database Integration Tasks
- Ensure Authentication and Security (e.g., Roles, Policies, JWT)
- Perform CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Implementing Pagination for data sets
- Implementing data search functionality
- Implementing Data Validation
- Develop API
- Test database operations (Unit testing, Integration testing)
    -   Write unit tests and integration tests for your database operations using Jest and other testing libraries

#### Examples of Projects Using Databases:
- Social Media Platform : Building a full-stack social media platform
- E-commerce Website : Creating an e-commerce website with product listings and user authentication
- Blogging Platform : Developing a blogging platform with user-generated content and comments
- Real Estate Listings Website : Creating a real estate listing website with search functionality and user authentication

#### Application Development Environments For Connecting Database:
